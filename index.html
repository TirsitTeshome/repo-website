    <p style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;"> Starting my coding journey at AkiraChix has been nothing short of a thrilling experience. The first week, especially, was a rollercoaster ride of emotions, challenges, and achievements that set the stage for the intense learning process to come. 
        The first day was a day of anticipation and rather a lot of nervousness. When I arrived, I was greeted by a room full of happy alumni faces. And because I arrived on Friday night, the weekends were full of basic sessions. Including discussions on the safeguarding policy. We even did a role play about it.

    <p style="color:black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;"> The food in AkiraChix is somewhat different from the kinds of foods I used to eat in my country, Ethiopia. And I thought that would be a big problem, actually it was for sometime because I could not get used to some of the Kenyan foods but then I realised that the food is adaptable. 
        And I’m becoming quite fond of it.</p>
        <p style="color:black; font-family: font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px"> Here are some pictures of the food we usually eat at the campus.</p>

<p style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">The first week of AkiraChix was a transformative experience. It was a week of learning and bonding with fellow future software developers, UI designers and product managers. The intensive, immersive nature of the campus ensured that I was always engaged and motivated. In hindsight, I can confidently say that this first week laid a good foundation for the way forward, and I am set to continue growing and learning in the coming weeks.
